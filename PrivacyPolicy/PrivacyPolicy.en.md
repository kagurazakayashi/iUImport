# PhotoCable Privacy Policy

Thank you for using **PhotoCable** (“the App”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the App to understand how your information is handled.

## 1. App Functionality

PhotoCable is a tool that enables users to import photos from a computer to their mobile device via a USB connection. The entire transfer process is conducted **locally** between devices, without any use of internet or network communication.

## 2. Permissions Requested

To function properly, the App **only requests permission to write to your photo library**, allowing imported photos to be saved to your device’s system album.  
The App does **not access, read, or upload any personal photos or files** from your device.

Additionally, to enable USB data transfer, your mobile device may prompt you to "Trust This Computer." This is a standard OS-level security measure and is **not controlled or initiated by the App itself**.

## 3. Network Communication

The App **does not access the internet** and contains **no network functionality whatsoever**. No data is uploaded, shared, or transmitted externally. All actions and data processing occur **entirely on your local device**.

## 4. Third-Party Dependencies

- On **macOS**, USB photo transfer works natively without additional software.
- On **Windows**, the App relies on Apple’s official **iTunes** components to enable USB communication.

Please note that **iTunes is a third-party product developed and maintained by Apple Inc.** Its privacy practices are governed by Apple’s own privacy policy, which is entirely independent of this App. We recommend reviewing Apple’s terms if you use their software.

## 5. Data Collection and Usage

This App is a fully offline utility tool. It **does not collect, store, or process any personal data**. There are no analytics, tracking SDKs, advertising services, or cloud integrations embedded in the App.

## 6. Global Availability

PhotoCable is intended for **global distribution**. This Privacy Policy is designed to reflect **data minimization, full local execution, and zero data collection**, ensuring consistent privacy standards for users across different countries and regions.

## 7. Feedback & Contact

This App is independently developed and maintained.  
If you have any privacy-related concerns, questions, or feedback, please reach out directly via the **App Store feedback page**.
